I got tired of manually changing people's ranks on every single server I have, so I decided to create this handy plugin!


This plugin allows you to sync user's rank with a MySQL database. It only syncs the rank so you can have different permissions for different servers (Ex: A survival server and a creative server)


Features:

    Sync user's ranks with a MySQL database
    Manage ranks with easy to use commands

Steps:

    Setup a database and a user in your MySQL
    Add the plugin to your server, then shut it down
    Edit the config to your liking
    Start up the server
    You're done :)


Commands:

    /add (Steam64) (Rank) (Name - Optional)
    /remove (Steam64)


Permissions:

    ranks.add
    ranks.remove
