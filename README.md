*I got tired of manually changing people's ranks on every single server I have, so I decided to create this handy plugin!*

This plugin allows you to sync user's rank with a MySQL database. It only syncs the rank so you can have different permissions for different servers (Ex: A survival server and a creative server)

---

**Features**:

    Sync user's ranks with a MySQL database
    Manage ranks with easy to use commands

---

**Installation**:

    Setup a database and a user in your MySQL
    Add the plugin to your server, then shut it down
    Edit the config to your liking
    Start up the server
    You're done :)

Commands:

    /add <player/steam64> <rank>
    /remove <steam64> <rank>

Permissions:

    ranks.add
    ranks.remove
